## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)** and **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** techniques in **QA Testing**. These black-box testing techniques help in optimizing test case coverage by reducing redundancy and ensuring that key boundary conditions are tested.

The goal is to provide a structured approach to creating effective test cases while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**: Divides the input data into partitions or ranges to minimize the number of test cases while covering all scenarios.
- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: Focuses on testing the boundaries of input ranges, where defects are more likely to occur.
- Includes **test case templates** for both EP and BVA.
- Ready-to-use examples for real-world applications.
